# Knowledge base vault  

This is my Obsidian Vault setup, which Iâ€™ve found ideal for taking notes while studying.  
Check out my [blog](https://0x531fm4d3-blog.pages.dev/miscs/effective-notes-with-obsidian) for a more in-depth explanation of how everything works.

# Quick start  

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download).  
2. After running the client for the first time, choose "Open folder as vault".
3. choose the folder "Knowledge Base" and and you're good to go.
4. Some hotkeys (feel free to change/add):    
    - ```CTRL + Q```-> create a new note based on the Vault's templates.  
    - ``` ALT + up/down``` -> move selected row/s up or down.
    - ```CTRL + Page down``` -> go to next tab.
    - ```CTRL + page up``` -> go to previous tab.

# Template creation explained
After pressing CTRL + Q, you'll be prompted to choose the template for the note you want to create.  
Template names prefixed with ```link``` create a link in the current note to the new note you're creating.
